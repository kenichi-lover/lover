First Love: The Flutter of Youth

When I was 15 years old, I met my first love, Daiyuanyuan. She was my middle school classmate (we attended the same school for six years), with a sweet smile and a cheerful personality. We spent many wonderful times together, sharing the joys and worries of our youth. At that time, although we were full of longing for the future, we also lacked mature thinking due to our youth. In the end, we parted ways because of our own academic and family reasons. Despite this, Daiyuanyuan's smile and the pure love she brought to me still shine in my memory to this day.


Gaokao Encounter: Gentle Companionship

At the age of 19, I met Dengfang, a friend of a friend. Xiaorou was gentle and considerate, with a deep understanding of others. We met at a gathering and hit it off with each other. Her warmth brought a sense of tranquility to my busy life. We once got very close, but due to the different paths our lives took, we ultimately did not end up together. Dengfang's gentleness and kindness are still remembered fondly by me to this day.


Encounter in the Workplace: The Attraction of Maturity

At the age of 28, I met Yuanyuan in my work, who was my girlfriend. Yuanyuan was intelligent and capable, exuding the charm of a professional woman. We worked well together and gradually developed a fondness for each other. Her wisdom and composure deeply impressed me, but our relationship could not progress further due to her career ambitions and my family responsibilities at the time. Whenever I recall that period, Yuanyuan's figure is always so clear. She is the most unforgettable mentor and friend in my professional career.
